### How to use
    The control panel is at the right hand side, just use it as normal canvas. The function description is as follows, including the usage of each button. The bonus widgets are marked as well.

### Function description
    I'll describe every feature from top to bottom, and from left to right.

    Choose the brush size you want from the range of 1 to 20.

    -	Upload
    Users can upload an image and paste it. Since the position of the image is set as (w - img.width)/2,10, if the image is too big, it won’t fit the canvas. The images from my file work fine.
