## How to use
The control panel is at the right hand side, just use it as normal canvas. The function description is as follows, including the usage of each button. The bonus widgets are marked as well.

## Function
I'll describe every feature from top to bottom, and from left to right.

* Color selector <br>
    Choose the color you want from the 7 colors listed. The cursor will change after clicking the button.
* Brush size slider <br>
    Choose the brush size you want from the range of 1 to 20.
* Font style selector <br>
    Choose the font style you want from the five options listed
* Font size selector <br>
    Choose the font size you want ranging from 5 to 90 (certain value is skipped due to practicality)
* Bold switch <br>
    Make the text bold if you like.
* Italic switch <br>
    Make the text italic if you like.
* hidden feature  <br>
    You may select the color of your text as well. Just use the color selector for the brush. Please make sure to select the color AFTER you choose the font style, font size, or simply after you click the keyboard button.
* Eraser <br>
    Erase stuff. You may choose the size of the eraser through the brush size slider. The cursor will change after clicking the button.
* Keyboard <br>
    Press it to start texting. After you press this button, click wherever position you want the text to be. When you finish typing, press enter on your computer. The cursor will change after clicking the button.
* Upload <br>
    Users can upload an image and paste it. Since the position of the image is set as (w - img.width)/2,10, if the image is too big, it won’t fit the canvas. The images from my file work fine.
* Circle <br>
    Drag the cursor to make circles of different sizes. Changing colors is available, just click the color you want from the color selector. The cursor will change after clicking the button.
* Triangle <br>
    Drag the cursor to make triangles of different sizes. Changing colors is available, just click the color you want from the color selector. The cursor will change after clicking the button.
* Rectangle <br>
    Drag the cursor to make rectangles of different sizes. Changing colors is available, just click the color you want from the color selector. The cursor will change after clicking the button.
* Undo
* Redo
* Download <br>
    Download the current canvas as an image file

* Open camera <br>
    This is a feature for you to take photos from your web camera, and automatically paste it on canvas. This feature won't be available if the website doesn’t have the permission of accessing your webcam.
* Add a photo <br>
    Click the button(camera with a plus sign) whenever you are ready to take a photo. Multiple clicks are allowed.
* Video playing <br>
    Secret feature. Please click the button and discover on your own.
* Refresh <br>
    Reset canvas 
* Dark mode <br>
    The fanciest feature nowadays!! Especially practical for CS students :)
